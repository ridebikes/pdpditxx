my first iText application based on my iText testing code

I used all the different things I tried in my iText7 app, and tried to put them together in a way that you could run it with a zip file. 
This way, I can have the configuration options in a JSON file, and put that in a zip, and choose which thing it will do.
I am still pretty new at this, so if anyone has suggestions on better ways to do this, that would be great !
For now, it is run the exe, and add the zip file name as an arg, and it will unzip and do which thing you set true in the JSON.
